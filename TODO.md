# TODO: Add Loading Bar for Get Response in responses.html

## Steps to Complete:
- [x] Add HTML element for loading bar (a div with id="loading-bar" positioned at the top of the page).
- [x] Add CSS styles for the loading bar: minimal animated gradient bar, hidden by default, responsive.
- [x] Modify JavaScript to show loading bar before fetch starts and hide it after fetch completes (success or error).
- [ ] Test the page to ensure loading bar appears during fetch and disappears after, looks good on mobile and desktop.
